        "Hi there.\n\nFirst things first. You should be aware that youtube processes each and every video uploaded, and its AI is amazing that it flags the video for copyrights if it finds copywrited content as soon as its uploaded, and you will not be able to publish the video.\n\nRead through all the pages to know how I work.",

        "**                          Page ðŸ“„ 3/5** \n\n **Create your youtube channel**\n\nThere is no point in using me if you dont have a Youtube Channel.So go through the given steps to create one.\n\n**Step 1:** __Sign in to YouTube on a computer or using the mobile.__\n\n**Step 2:** __Try any action that requires a channel, such as uploading a video, posting a comment, or creating a playlist.__\n\n**Step 3:** __If you don't yet have a channel, you'll see a prompt to create a channel.__\n\n**Step 4:** __Check the details and confirm to create your new channel.__",

        "**                          Page ðŸ“„ 4/5** \n\n **Verify your YouTube account**\n\nYoutube take spam and abuse very seriously. So you are asked to verify your Youtube account. Once you've verified your account, you will be able to upload videos longer than 15 minutes. If you haven't verified your account every video uploaded which are longer than 15 minutes will be removed.\n[Verify your Youtube account here.](http://www.youtube.com/verify)\n\n__Remember to verify your project, else your uploads will be kept private.__",

        "**                          Page ðŸ“„ 5/5** \n\n **Now lets authorise.**\n\nYou need to give me the access to upload videos to your Youtube account.For that open the given link and allow access and copy the code. Come back here and type /authorise copied-code (eg: 4/4Ewa...) and send it.\n\n**Fear not!**\nI'm not a hacker or someone who wants to creep into people's privacy. I respect one's privacy. I'm here just to help anyone who wants help. If I was a hacker I won't be sitting here writing Telegram Bots.\n\n If you have any problem you can ask for support at [My Support Group](https://t.me/HxSupport)"
